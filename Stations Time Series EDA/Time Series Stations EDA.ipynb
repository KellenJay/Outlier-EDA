    "**Similarities:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All four stations exhibit seasonal patterns, with AQI levels peaking during winter months **(December–February)** and dropping during summer **(June–August).**\n",
    "2. High daily fluctuations in AQI at all stations suggest that air quality is strongly influenced by short-term factors such as weather, pollution events, and human activity.\n",
    "3. he general trend across stations indicates improving air quality mid-2022, followed by a gradual decline towards late 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Differences:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Absolute AQI Values:** MER consistently records the highest AQI, followed by PED. BJU and TLA have relatively lower AQI values, suggesting better air quality.\n",
    "2. **Magnitude of Fluctuations:** MER and PED stations experience larger AQI swings compared to BJU and TLA, indicating higher sensitivity to pollution events.\n",
    "3. **Specific Peaks and Dips:** Unique local factors influence air quality at each station. The PED station saw a sharp increase in AQI in early 2024, while BJU recorded an unusual peak in January 2023.\n"
